# Very Simply Climate Model (VSCM)

A very simple multiple linear regression model of the Earth's climate in Python.


## Features

* CO2 concentration in the atmosphere in PPM
* Methane concentration in the atmosphere in PPB
* SO2 emissions per year
* Solar irradiance

Predicting:

* Average global temperature anomaly  


Other assumptions:

* Pre-industrial level of CO2: 280 PPM
* Pre-industrial level of Methane: 700 PPB
